# Interject Datacell Request Time Data Exploration

The purpose of this project was to explore data that had been collected at Interject over the years pertaining to the durations of time taken for certain Interject reporting functions to execute. This data was collected on a per-client basis, and could be used to gain insight into possible better ways clients could use these reporting functions for greater performance gains.

The Jupyter Notebook is intended to be used by both by developers at Interject, to find possible bugs or performance tie-ups, and by clients, to gain insight into better ways of using reporting functions in their projects to optimize performance.

Interject is a data-solutions company that focuses on improving the productivity of their clients' businesses in the areas of reporting and accounting, data management, and other custom solutions. I worked as a member of the Interject student team from May 2019 until February 2020. Check out Interject's website at: gointerject.com.

This project was developed solely by me.
