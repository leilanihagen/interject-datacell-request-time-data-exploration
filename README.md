# Interject Projects

Two of the projects that I completed while working at Interject. Interject is a data-solutions company that focuses on improving the productivity of their client's businesses in the areas of reporting and accounting, data management, and other custom solutions. I worked as a member of the Interject student team from May 2019 until February 2020, and these were two of the projects that I completed during my time there. Both of these projects were developed by me largely solo and were mostly self-managed. Check out Interject's website at: gointerject.com.
